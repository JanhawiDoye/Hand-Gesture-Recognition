# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Developed a model using deep learning and machine learning. Created our own dataset, encompassing all alphabets and numbers, and harnessed LSTM layers and fully connected layers to train the model, increasing accuracy by 15%. Resulted in 98% accuracy in predicting hand gestures corresponding to ASL and integrating them into meaningful sentences.
